# Unity Project: Vehicle Control and Side-Scroller Challenges

Welcome to my Unity repository, where I share my project developed as part of the official Unity course. This project is a vehicle control and side-scroller challenge, covering various aspects of game development.

## Project description

### Vehicle Control on Challenging Track
In the first scenario, players take control of a vehicle on a track full of obstacles. Challenges include the presence of an opposing vehicle coming from the opposite direction. I completed all the challenges proposed by Unity, such as dynamic camera switching and support for two simultaneous players.

### Side-Scroller Aerial Challenges
In the second part of the project, players get into an exciting side-scroller, controlling an aircraft. Inspired by the style of Flappy Bird, this scene presents unique challenges, including solving bugs left on purpose as part of the challenge proposed by Unity.
